This section describes how to install the localeurl application in your Django
project.


Prerequisites
-------------

The localeurl application requires Django_ 1.0 or higher.

.. _Django: http://www.djangoproject.com/download/


Installation
------------

Installation basically consists of installing the middleware. If you want to
use the template tags and filters also add localeurl to the installed
applications.

#. Place the ``localeurl`` module in your Python path. You can put it into your
   Django project directory or run ``python setup.py install`` from a shell.

#. Add ``'localeurl.middleware.LocaleURLMiddleware'`` to
   ``settings.MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``. It must come *before*
   ``'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware'`` or ``settings.APPEND_SLASH``
   will not work.

#. Add ``'localeurl'`` to ``settings.INSTALLED_APPS``. Because the application
   needs to replace the standard ``urlresolvers.reverse`` function, it is
   important to place it high in the list.

#. Make sure ``settings.LANGUAGE_CODE`` or its root language is in
   ``settings.LANGUAGES``. For example, if ``LANGUAGE_CODE == 'en-us'`` then
   ``LANGUAGES`` must contain either ``'en-us'`` or ``'en'``. If you have not
   changed either option you do not have to do anything.


.. _configuration:

Configuration
-------------

The application can be configured by editing the project's ``settings.py``
file.

``LOCALE_INDEPENDENT_PATHS``
  A tuple of regular expression objects matching paths that will not be
  redirected to add the language prefix. For example, a site with a language
  selection splash page would add ``'^/$'`` as a locale independent path match.
  Note that for performance reasons you must use ``re`` objects, not strings.
  Additionally, any path starting with ``settings.MEDIA_URL`` will also not be
  redirected if it is a path, i.e. not a full URL.

Example::

  import re
  LOCALE_INDEPENDENT_PATHS = (
      re.compile('^/$'),
      re.compile('^/games/'),
      re.compile('^/ajax/'),
  )

``PREFIX_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`` (default: ``True``)
  Whether to add the prefix for the default language
  (``settings.LANGUAGE_CODE``). For example, if ``LANGUAGE_CODE == 'en'`` then
  the path ``/about/`` will be passed to the URL resolver unchanged and
  ``/en/about/`` will be redirected to ``/about/``.
